            "content" : `Prominent ear surgeries are usually performed to bring the auricle closer to the head, shrink large ears or shape the missing folds. The main reason for prominent ear aesthetics is the inadequate development or flatness of the Y-shaped curvature of the auricle, and that the ears are at an angle away from the head. This operation is usually performed from the age of six when the ear development is completed. Although it is performed from these ages, it is common to  see this surgery in the twenties.
                        \nWomen with prominent-ear problems may want to have surgery due to various reasons such as inability to tie their hair and men to have short hair. Prominent ear aesthetic surgery is often performed under local anesthesia. If the patient is a child, general anesthesia may be required.
                        \nImpressed dressing to be applied to the patient after prominent ear aesthetics is extremely important. The ear is an extremely well-blooded organ. With the pressure to be applied, blood leakage between tissues after prominent ear surgery will be prevented. Ears may cause pain for a few days, but this can be relieved by medication.
                        \nAfter prominent ear aesthetics, the dressing will be removed after 4-5 days and the ear will be wrapped with a lighter dressing. After removal of all wraps, tennis bandage is recommended especially for lying. Wearing the tennis bandage during the day will help to maintain the shape of the ear better. The sutures in the ear region usually dissolve spontaneously and disappear within a week. The prominent ear will be edematous around 7-10 days after surgery. Any activity where the ear will bend should be avoided for 1.5 months. Most adults can return to work within an average of 5-7 days. Children can go to school after about 7 days, but they need to be very careful with the activities.`

The most appropriate strategy for each case will then be deduced.Basically in the presence of a request for surgical correction of the abdominal wall, two cases can be observed: either a abdominal liposuction will be considered alone or a abdominoplasty will have to be used.Abdominoplasty remains a fairly heavy procedure in plastic surgery but it has fully benefited from many technical improvements in recent years: lighter anesthetic procedures, so-called "superior high tension" techniques, padding methods, improved suture practices, improved bandages and compression sleeves…

Thanks to collagen, the skin is elastic, firm and smooth. Unfortunately, people over the age of 25 lose up to 1.5% of this valuable item each year, and so the first wrinkles start to form. So, as a result of aging, they both decrease in number and quality.

The area where the hair follicle will be taken and transplanted is numbed with local anesthetic. The micro motor tip is brought close to the center of the hair and dipped into the skin and pulled in accordance with the exit angle of the hair. The hair is cut in a cylindrical manner, along with the follicle and the microscopic tissue surrounding it. It is gently pulled with a micro forceps and the follicular unit comes off the loose base.

                        Most spinal tumors have spread (metastasized) from another area of the body. For patients with cancer elsewhere in the body, any new complaint of spine pain or neurological deficits requires an immediate evaluation to determine if the cancer has spread to the spine.
                        There are three common types of spinal tumors that can cause back pain: vertebral column tumors, intradural-extramedullary tumors, and intramedullary tumors.
                        \n1. Vertebral Column Primary Tumors: These tumors occur in the vertebral column, and grow either from the bone or disc elements of the spine. They typically occur in younger adults. Osteogenic sarcoma (osteosarcoma) is the most common malignant bone tumor. Most primary spinal tumors are quite rare and usually grow slowly.
                        \n2. Intradural-Extramedullary Tumors: Intradural-Extramedullary (inside the dura) tumors grow within the spinal canal (under the membrane that covers the spinal cord) but outside of the nerves. Usually these tumors are benign and slow growing. However, they can cause symptoms of pain and weakness.
                        \n Most of these spinal tumors are:
                        \nMeningiomas that occur in the membranes surrounding the spinal cord and are usually benign but may be malignant. These tumors are more common in middle age and elderly women.
                        \nNerve sheath tumors (schwannomas and neurofibromas) that arise from the nerve roots that come off the spinal cord. Again, this type of tumor is usually benign and slow growing, and it may be years before any neurological problems occur.
                        \n3. Intramedullary Tumors: Intramedullary tumors grow from inside the spinal cord or inside the individual nerves and often arise from the cells that provide physical support and insulation for the nervous system (glial cells). These tumors occur most often in the cervical spine (neck). They tend to be benign, but surgery to remove the tumor may be difficult.
                        \n The two most common types of intramedullary tumors are astrocytomas and ependymomas.`

                        \nMany times, these patients have additional serious injuries that require rapid treatment. The spinal cord may also be injured, depending on the severity of the fracture.
                        \nSpinal fractures may also be caused by bone insufficiency. For example, people with osteoporosis, tumors, or other underlying conditions that weaken the bone can fracture a vertebra even during low-impact activities–such as reaching or twisting. These fractures may develop unnoticed over a period of time, with no symptoms or discomfort until a bone breaks.`

                        \nScoliosis is abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine. The spinal curve may develop as a single curve (shaped like the letter C) or as two curves (shaped like the letter S). In children and teens, scoliosis often does not have any noticeable symptoms and may not be noticeable until it has progressed significantly. The two most common forms are degenerative scoliosis and idiopathic scoliosis (adolescent). Three orthopedically approved options exist for combating scoliosis: observation, bracing, or surgery.
                        \n2. Juvenile Disc Disorder
                        \nJuvenile disc disorder, or juvenile discogenic disorder, represents a condition where the endplates of the disc spaces are not strong enough to withstand the pressures generated within the disc spaces. This leads to disc herniations into the vertebral bodies (called Schmorl’s nodes) and causes back pain at an early age.This condition is sometimes referred to as Scheuermann’s disease, or Lumbar Scheuermann’s disease, but the preferred medical terminology for this condition is juvenile disc disorder. Juvenile disc disorder is not as common as Scheuermann’s kyphosis and is not associated with deformity of the spine. Patients with juvenile disc disorder usually have lower back pain that is made worse with bending forward and activity, and feels better with rest. This condition is very much like degenerative disc disease in the adult population, but the degeneration starts at a much earlier age, and usually involves most of the discs of the lumbar spine (as opposed to only one or two discs typically involved in degenerative disc disease).
                        \n3. Schuermann’s Kyphosis
                        \nScheuermann’s disease, or Scheuermann’s kyphosis, is a condition in which the normal roundback in the upper spine (called a kyphosis) is increased. Most people with Scheuermann’s disease will have an increased roundback (e.g. a hunch back or hump back) but no pain. The name of this condition comes from Scheuermann, the person who in 1921 described changes in the vertebral endplates and disc space that can occur during development and lead to kyphosis, or roundback deformity of the thoracic spine (upper back).
                        \nThe cause of Scheuermann’s disease is unknown, but is thought to be due to a growth abnormality of the vertebral body. The growth plate anteriorly (in the front) stops growing but the posterior part of the growth plate continues to grow. This is due to a condition known as osteochondrosis. The wedge-shape of the vertebra creates an increase in the amount of normal kyphosis (front angulation of the thoracic spine) The wedging of vertebrae in Scheuermann’s kyphosis is most common in the thoracic spine (upper back), with the apex of the curve typically between the T7 and T9 levels of the spine. Although less common, Scheuermann’s kyphosis may also occur in the junction between the thoracic and lumbar spine (thoracolumbar spine) or in the lumbar spine (lower back). Scheuermann’s disease does not spread and is not really a “disease” but a condition that can arise during growth. It is more common in males and appears in adolescents usually towards the end of their growth spurt. If the roundback deformity is severe, patients are more likely to have discomfort or pain along with the deformity as they age.`

The dislocation mechanism generally occurs during falls while the hand is in the open position by shoulder is being forced out. When the shoulder joint dislocates, an unbearable pain occurs with a swelling on the front of the shoulder. In this case, it is not possible for the patient to move his shoulder and arm.
                        \nAt a young age a patient with shoulder dislocation for the first time; arm joint is placed to back its socket with a closed method and three weeks of arm sling use is enough for healing. In young patients, some tissues need to be torn for the development of dislocations due to their robust shoulder structures. The most common of these is, the separation of the cartilage support called labrum at its adhesion site from the bone. In addition, loosening of the shoulder capsule is one of the causes of dislocation and semi-dislocation. Due to being damaged, if the first dislocation of should age is lower than 20, re-occurring probability of shoulder dislocation is %90. However, if the first shoulder dislocation is over 40 years of age, the re-occurring probability decreases to 10%. Re-occurring dislocations; while cause detoriation in shoulder joint and arthritis, also permanent damages may occur in muscles and tendons which are around of shoulder. Also, shoulder dislocations which occur at unexpected times, causing additional disabilities. For all these reasons, surgical treatment is recommended for re-occurring shoulder dislocations.
                        \nIn the elderly patient group, shoulder joint dislocations can also be accompanied by fractures. In elderly patients, these dislocations are treated surgically or under anaesthesia, and re-dislocation is unlikely except in special cases.`

PRP is prepared from blood, while SVF is prepared from adipose tissue. If we translate PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) into speaking language, we can say blood which is enriched from coagulation cells. In this application; the blood taken from the person is subjected to a special treatment; the coagulation cells are separated then turned into serum. This serum contains various proteins that stimulate the healing of the body. Thanks to these proteins, PRP treatment has a stimulating effect on healing.

Thus, a stronger tissue repair can be achieved by stimulating the transformation of stem cells to the original cells of the tissue, which applied to the damaged area.

This ring is connected by a tube or catheter to a small housing placed under the skin. This case allows the ring to be tightened according to weight loss. A simple injection of saline into the case will then gradually fill the ring. The ring is designed as a wheel with an inner tube inside and therefore the supply of liquid into this tube will reduce the amount of food that can pass through the stomach.
            \nThe purpose of placing this ring around the stomach is to reach, by successive tightening, the threshold of increase in intra gastric pressure sufficient to trigger satiety reflexes and thus reduce the amount of food consumed by patients.`

This treatment is applied with endoscopic methods and it takes 20-30 minutes. After spending 2 hours under observation, patients can go back home. Patients can go back to their normal lives next day. Healing period of this treatment is extremely short. When this treatment that shows affects in 3-7 days is supported with personalised diet program, patients will start to lose weight in 1 month and this process will continue 6 months.`

                        \nIn vitro fertilization is the standard treatment for women or men with fertility problems such as:
                        \n1. Absent or blocked fallopian tubes;

The chances of success increase for a greater number of cycles performed. It is usually recommended not to start in vitro fertilization after 42 years of age.`

The lens, the inner lens of the eye, acts like a camera lens and allows a sharp image to be formed on the retina.Cataracts are characterized by a progressive but inevitable decrease in visual acuity. Darkening the lens can take years to become embarrassing for the patient.The first signs of the disease appear with vision problems at first from a distance, a feeling of fog, a change in the perception of colours and contrasts, a doubling of vision with only one eye, hypersensitivity to light (photophobia), difficulty in driving at night due to glare from headlights (decreased twilight visual acuity).
                        \nGenerally appearing around the age of 55-60, the patient's aging makes it the main cause of this vision disorder. Other secondary factors such as diabetes, smoking, heredity, nutrition, prolonged exposure to the sun's UV rays, eye trauma, eye diseases such as glaucoma can also cause cataracts.The absence of light passing through the lens does not allow a correction of the discomfort caused by simply wearing glasses.Only cataract surgery can treat the phenomenon.`

This operation makes it possible to dispense with a correction system (glasses or contact lenses).The cornea is the transparent membrane at the front of the eye: with the lens, it redirects light behind the eye to the retina.
                        \nIn case of vision problems, redesigning the cornea with a laser allows the light beam to be redirected so that the image is clearly formed on the retina.This intervention has been extremely successful: nearly 22 million people have used it.`
